/**
 * Safely checks whether an Amplify DataStore model instance is a tombstone.

 * DataStore attaches an internal `_deleted` flag to models that have been deleted

 * in `src/models/index.d.ts`, so consumers must treat it as runtime metadata.
 *
 * @param item - Any value (typically a DataStore model instance)
 * @returns True if the value is an object with an own `_deleted` property set to `true`
