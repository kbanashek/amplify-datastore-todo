# Cursor Rules for Amplify DataStore Todo App

This project uses modular cursor rules organized in the `.cursor/rules/` directory.

## Rule Files (6 consolidated files)

| File               | Description                                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `code-style.mdc`   | TypeScript best practices, arrow functions, object map patterns |
| `architecture.mdc` | Component architecture, package structure, utility extraction   |
| `aws-amplify.mdc`  | AWS Amplify DataStore conventions, ModelName constants          |
| `development.mdc`  | Testing, logging, documentation, and project todos              |
| `workflow.mdc`     | Version control, GitHub Actions, CI/CD workflows                |
| `react-native.mdc` | React Native component patterns, UI/UX conventions              |

All rules are automatically applied. See individual rule files in `.cursor/rules/` for detailed guidelines.
