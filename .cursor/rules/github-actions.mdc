# GitHub Actions Workflow Standards

## PR Checks Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`

**Purpose:** Run essential checks on all pull requests to ensure code quality before merging.

### Structure

The PR checks workflow consists of **two separate jobs** that run in parallel:

1. **`lint`** - Runs ESLint to check code quality
   - Job name: `Lint`
   - Command: `yarn lint`
   - Must pass for PR to be mergeable

2. **`unit-tests`** - Runs unit tests with coverage
   - Job name: `Unit Tests`
   - Command: `yarn test --coverage --watchAll=false --passWithNoTests --testPathIgnorePatterns=".*(TranslationService|DataStore|Amplify).*"`
   - Skips AWS-dependent tests in CI environment
   - May continue on error (non-blocking for merge)

### Naming Convention

**ALWAYS use clear, descriptive job names:**
- ✅ Good: `name: Lint` (clear what it does)
- ✅ Good: `name: Unit Tests` (clear what it does)
- ❌ Bad: `name: Run Unit Tests` (redundant - "Run" is implied)
- ❌ Bad: `name: test` (too generic)
- ❌ Bad: `name: PR Tests` (doesn't indicate what type of tests)

**Workflow name should match purpose:**
- ✅ Good: `name: PR Checks` (indicates it's for PR validation)
- ❌ Bad: `name: PR Tests` (misleading if it also runs lint)

### Job Separation

**ALWAYS separate lint and tests into different jobs:**
- Allows parallel execution (faster CI)
- Clear visibility of which check failed
- Independent failure handling

**DO NOT combine lint and tests in a single job:**
- ❌ Bad: Single job that runs both `yarn lint` and `yarn test`
- ✅ Good: Separate `lint` and `unit-tests` jobs

### Trigger Configuration

**PR checks should trigger on:**
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - develop
      - main
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
```

**DO NOT trigger on push events for PR checks:**
- PR checks are only needed for pull requests
- Push events should use separate workflows (e.g., test-coverage.yml)

### Error Handling

**Lint job:**
- Must fail the workflow if lint errors are found
- No `continue-on-error: true` on the lint step

**Unit tests job:**
- May use `continue-on-error: true` if tests are non-critical
- Should still report test results even if some tests fail

### Coverage

**Coverage is included in the unit-tests job:**
- Use `--coverage` flag in test command
- Upload coverage reports as artifacts (optional)
- Coverage reporting is handled by separate `test-coverage.yml` workflow for push events

## Test Coverage Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/test-coverage.yml`

**Purpose:** Generate detailed coverage reports and upload to Codecov on push events.

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- **NOT** on pull requests (coverage is included in PR checks)

## Best Practices

### Job Names

- Use clear, action-oriented names
- Avoid redundancy (don't say "Run" when it's implied)
- Match the actual command being executed

### Workflow Organization

- One workflow per purpose (PR checks, coverage, deployment, etc.)
- Keep workflows focused and single-purpose
- Use descriptive workflow names

### Parallel Execution

- Separate independent checks into separate jobs
- Jobs run in parallel by default (faster CI)
- Use `needs:` only when jobs must run sequentially

### CodeArtifact Authentication

- Always configure AWS credentials with `continue-on-error: true`
- Fall back to public npm registry if CodeArtifact auth fails
- Ensure dependencies install successfully even without AWS credentials

### Example Structure

```yaml
name: PR Checks

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [develop, main]
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  lint:
    name: Lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile
      - run: yarn lint

  unit-tests:
    name: Unit Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile
      - run: yarn test --coverage --watchAll=false
```

## Auto Merge Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml`

**Purpose:** Automatically merge pull requests when all required checks pass and conditions are met.

### How It Works

1. **Triggers on:**
   - PR opened, synchronized, reopened, or marked ready for review
   - Check suite completion
   - Status updates

2. **Conditions:**
   - Only runs for PRs targeting `develop` or `main` branches
   - Waits for all required status checks to pass
   - Respects branch protection rules (approvals, etc.)

3. **Merge Behavior:**
   - Uses squash merge method
   - Automatically deletes the source branch after merge
   - Adds a comment to the PR when auto-merge is enabled

### Configuration

The workflow uses `peter-evans/enable-pull-request-automerge@v3` which:
- Automatically waits for all required checks to pass
- Respects branch protection rules
- Handles merge conflicts gracefully
- Only enables auto-merge when PR is ready

### Merge Method

Currently configured to use **squash merge**:
- Creates a single commit from all PR commits
- Keeps commit history clean
- Can be changed to `merge` or `rebase` if needed

### Notes

- Auto-merge respects branch protection rules (required approvals, status checks, etc.)
- If checks fail, auto-merge will not be enabled
- The workflow will retry when checks complete
- PRs can still be manually merged if needed

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Misleading job names** - "Run Unit Tests" when it also runs lint
2. **Combining checks** - Running lint and tests in the same job
3. **Unclear workflow names** - "PR Tests" when it's actually "PR Checks"
4. **Missing error handling** - Not handling CodeArtifact auth failures gracefully
5. **Redundant workflows** - Multiple workflows doing the same thing
6. **Auto-merge without checks** - Always ensure required checks pass before enabling auto-merge
