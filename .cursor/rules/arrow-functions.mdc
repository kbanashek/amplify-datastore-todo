# Prefer Arrow Functions (when it makes sense)

## Rule

- Prefer **arrow functions** for:
  - **React components**
  - **hooks** (custom hooks and hook callbacks)
  - **event handlers** and callbacks
  - **small utilities** and one-off helpers
- Prefer **const-assigned arrows** for exported APIs:
  - ✅ Good: `export const buildPayload = (input: Input): Output => { ... }`

## React Components

- ✅ Preferred:

```ts
export const MyComponent: React.FC<MyProps> = ({ title }) => {
  return <View />;
};
```

- ✅ Also acceptable (if it reads cleaner):

```ts
export const MyComponent = ({ title }: MyProps): React.ReactElement => {
  return <View />;
};
```

## When `function` is acceptable

Use `function` declarations when they provide a concrete benefit:
- **Function overloads** (often clearer with `function`)
- **Generators** (`function*`)
- **Hoisting is required** (rare; prefer re-ordering instead)
- **Very large utilities** where `function name()` reads materially better

## Notes

- This rule is about **consistency and readability**, not dogma.
- Still follow the existing rules:
  - Type all params/returns
  - Avoid `any`
  - Extract standalone utilities into `utils/` with unit tests when applicable
