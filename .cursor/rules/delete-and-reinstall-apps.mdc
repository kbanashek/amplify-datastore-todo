# Delete and Reinstall Apps Command

## Purpose
Quickly delete and reinstall both iOS and Android apps from simulators/emulators. Useful for:
- Clearing corrupted local DataStore caches
- Testing fresh installs after adding packages
- Starting with clean state after schema changes

## Command Usage

When the user says:
- "delete and reinstall apps"
- "reinstall both apps"
- "fresh install"
- "delete apps"

Execute these steps:

### Step 1: Delete Both Apps
```bash
cd /Users/Kyle.Banashek/Source/orion-task-system && ./scripts/delete-apps.sh
```

Or use the package.json script:
```bash
yarn delete-apps
```

### Step 2: Reinstall Apps
After deletion completes, tell the user:
```
✅ Apps deleted. Now reinstall:
- Press 'i' for iOS
- Press 'a' for Android
(in the Expo terminal)
```

## Script Location
- Script: `scripts/delete-apps.sh`
- Package command: `yarn delete-apps`

## What It Does
1. Deletes iOS app from simulator: `xcrun simctl uninstall booted com.orion.tasksystem`
2. Deletes Android app from emulator: `adb uninstall com.orion.tasksystem`
3. Shows success/error messages for each

## Bundle Identifiers
