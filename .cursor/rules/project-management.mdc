# Project Management

## Project Todos

- **ALWAYS use `DOCS/todos.md` for tracking todos and future work**
- When identifying work that needs to be done:
  - Add it to `DOCS/todos.md` with a clear description
  - Group related todos under descriptive headings
  - Mark completed items with `[x]` instead of deleting them
  - Include file paths, code references, or context when relevant
- **Do NOT** create separate todo files or track todos in code comments
- **Do NOT** use TODO comments in code for tracking work - use `DOCS/todos.md` instead
- Format: `- [ ] Description of task` for incomplete, `- [x] Description` for complete
